A clean, elegant, and robust Hexo theme involved with whitespace (余白). Built
with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Made by Acris with ❤️

## Features

- **Clean Aesthetics**: Minimalist design with focus on typography and readability.
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern utility-first CSS framework.
- **Multi-language**: Supports English, Simplified Chinese (`zh-CN`), Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW`), Japanese (`ja-JP`),
  and French (`fr`).
- **Fast**: Optimized for performance with minimal Javascript.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository into your Hexo theme directory:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Acris/hexo-theme-shiro.git themes/shiro
   ```

2. Enable the theme in your Hexo root `_config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   theme: shiro
   ```

3. Create a dedicated theme config file `_config.shiro.yml` in your site root (Supported since Hexo 5.0.0). This file
   will have higher priority than the theme's default config.

## Configuration

Copy the content from `themes/shiro/_config.yml` to `_config.shiro.yml` in your site root.

```yaml
# Navigation menu
menu:
#  - name: Home
#    url: /
#  - name: Archives
#    url: /archives
#  - name: Categories
#    url: /categories
#  - name: Tags
#    url: /tags
#  - name: About
#    url: /about
#  - name: GitHub
#    url: https://github.com
#    # Open in new tab
#    target: _blank

```

### Creating Pages (Tags & Categories)

Since Hexo does not generate 'all tags' or 'all categories' pages by default, you need to create them manually if you
wish to use them in the menu.

1. Create the pages:
   ```bash
   hexo new page tags
   hexo new page categories
   ```

2. Modify `source/tags/index.md`:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Tags
   layout: tag
   ---
   ```

3. Modify `source/categories/index.md`:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Categories
   layout: category
   ---
   ```

## Development

If you want to modify the theme source code or contribute:

1. Install dependencies in the theme directory:
   ```bash
   cd themes/shiro
   npm install
   ```

2. Watch for CSS changes during development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build CSS (Tailwind):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
